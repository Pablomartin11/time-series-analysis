# Time Series Analysis

[![es](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-es-red.svg)](/README-ES.md)

An analysis made for a 240 monthly data time series for the number of turists that spend the night in Zamora between January 2000 and December 2019. 

The main point for this project is to adjust the best Box-Jenkins model we could and use it to make predictions two years ahead.
In order to achieve this, we analysed the raw time series with the programs Statgraphics and SAS.

To see the project open ```Analysis.pdf``` which is in the repository with the code in SAS at ```code.sas```
